# Setup

## Windows

- Clone this repo into

```ps
~/AppData/Local/nvim
```

- Install [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) following the instructions in their
`README`:

```ps
git clone https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim-data\site\pack\packer\start\packer.nvim"
```

- Run `:PackerSync` to install packages.

I had to run this several times to get everything installed
