# Intro

Based on [The Primeagen's Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE)

# Setup

## Windows

At the moment I recommend [neovide](https://neovide.dev/), since the bundled `nvim-qt` was
very laggy and became slow very fast.

- Clone this repo into

```ps
~/AppData/Local/nvim
```

## Linux

Make sure to have `nvim` version >= `0.9` installed.

- Clone this repo into

```sh
~/.config/nvim
```
